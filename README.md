Project Description-
This project involves performing **Sentiment Analysis** on a dataset containing textual reviews using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. It was completed as part of an internship task with **CodTech**.

Dataset-
- A unique and realistic dataset with 40 samples of text reviews
- Sentiment labels: `positive`, `neutral`, `negative`

Techniques Used :
- Text preprocessing: lowercase, punctuation removal, stopword removal, lemmatization
- Feature extraction: TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Classification Model: Logistic Regression
- Evaluation: Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

Insights :
- Balanced dataset helped the model learn diverse sentiment categories
- Logistic Regression gave a solid baseline performance
- Further improvements can include larger datasets and experimenting with different models



Conclusion-
This notebook showcases the end-to-end implementation of a sentiment analysis model, from raw text to insights, and is a valuable step forward in practical NLP experience.
